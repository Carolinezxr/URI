1- Time series remains non-stationary after first difference
Solution: take second difference. If you have noise about a polynomial trend of order k, then it takes differences of order k to remove.

2-Check.residuals() 
Time plot of residuals. X-axis is time. The same as time series plot. From 2018-08-04 06:07:00 to 2019-08-15 15:26:00

3-Insignificant mu
One possible explanation for the insignificant mu:
The input is diff(time series), so the intercept does not mean a baseline. It is the difference between two time periods (growth). So insignificant mu means that the difference between two time periods is not significant, which is reasonable. And Zone 6 and Zone 11 where mu is significant, experience a significant increase.

4-Difference between ARCH and GARCH
GARCH is just a more general variant of ARCH. 
‘In this paper a new, more general class of processes, GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedastic), is introduced, allowing for a much more flexible lag structure. The extension of the ARCH process to the GARCH process bears much resemblance to the extension of the standard time series AR process to the general ARMA process and, as is argued below, permits a more parsimonious description in many situations.’
